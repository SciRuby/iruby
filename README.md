# IRuby

This is a Ruby kernel for IPython/Jupyter and is part of [SciRuby](http://sciruby.com/). You can try it at [try.jupyter.org](http://try.jupyter.org/).

### Quick start
The installation instructions are divided according to environments mainly because of ZeroMQ.

#### Docker

If you're familiar with Docker, the following commands should work in most cases:

```
docker pull sciruby/iruby-notebook
docker run -d -p 8888:8888 sciruby/iruby-notebook start-notebook.sh --NotebookApp.token=''
```

and open a web browser to http://localhost:8888 .

`sciruby/iruby-notebook` is based on Minimal Jupyter Notebook Stack. See https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/base-notebook for more details on the Docker command options.

#### Ubuntu/Debian
At first install IPython/Jupyter. I recommend an installation using virtualenv.

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev python-virtualenv
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install 'ipython[notebook]'

After that, install the Ruby gem.

    gem install cztop
    gem install iruby

Now you can run iruby with:

    iruby notebook

#### Windows
At first install IPython/Jupyter. I recommend an installation using [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/).

Run two commands below:

    gem install cztop
    gem install iruby

Now you can run iruby with:

    iruby notebook

#### Mac
I recommend an installation using [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

After that, run three commands shown below.

    brew install libtool autoconf automake autogen
    gem install cztop
    gem install iruby

#### FreeBSD

At first install IPython/Jupyter. 
There is a pyzmq ports (ports/net/py-pyzmq) which depends on libzmq4, however, it doesn't works with ipython.
Therefore we use libzmq3 like the following:

1. make your ports tree up-to-date.
2. replace LIBDEPENDS line in ports/net/py-pyzmq/Makefile

    ```shell
    LIB_DEPENDS=    libzmq.so:${PORTSDIR}/net/libzmq4
    ```
    with
    ```shell
    LIB_DEPENDS=    libzmq.so:${PORTSDIR}/net/libzmq3
    ```
3. install related packages

    ```shell
    $ sudo pkg install libzmq3 py27-qt4-gui py27-pexpect-3.3 py27-qt4-svg py27-pygments py27-Jinja2 py27-tornado py27-jsonschema
    ```
4. make install using ports

    ```shell
    $ cd /usr/ports/net/py-pyzmq
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd /usr/ports/devel/ipython
    $ sudo make install
    ```
Then, install iruby and related ports and gems.
    ```shell
    $ sudo pkg install rubygem-mimemagic
    $ sudo gem install ffi-rzmq  # install ffi, ffi-rzmq-core and ffi-rzmq
    $ git clone https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby.git
    $ cd iruby
    $ gem build iruby.gemspec
    $ sudo gem install iruby-0.2.7.gem
    ```
### Installation for jRuby

Since jRuby is fully compatible with Ruby version 2.2, it is possible to use iruby with jRuby. 
It can be helpful if you want to use java classes in your iruby notebook.
This will require the following software:
* jRuby version >= 9.0.4.0
* cztop gem
* this iruby gem

After installation, make sure that your `env` is set up to jruby.
```shell
$ env ruby -v
```
If you use RVM, it is enough to switch the current version to jruby.
If you have already used iruby with a different version, you need to generate a new kernel:
```shell
$ iruby register --force
```
After that you can use iruby with jRuby in usual way.

### After the installation

Take a look at the [example notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/SciRuby/sciruby-notebooks/master/getting_started.ipynb)
and the [collection of notebooks](https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby-notebooks/) which includes a Dockerfile to create a containerized installation of iruby
and other scientific gems. You can find the prebuild image at [dockerhub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/minad/sciruby-notebooks/).


### Required dependencies

* IPython/Jupyter >= 3.0.0
* Ruby >= 2.1.0

If you install IRuby with CZTop, CZMQ >= 4.0.0 is added to the list above.

If you install IRuby with ffi-rzmq, libzmq >= 3.2 is added to the list above.
